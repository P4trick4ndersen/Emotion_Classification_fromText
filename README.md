# Emotion_Classification_fromText

This project involves fine-tuning a DistilBERT model to classify the emotional tone of text (e.g., joy, sadness, anger) based on individual sentences. Using a labeled dataset of emotional expressions, the model is trained to recognize and predict the underlying emotion from short text inputs.
